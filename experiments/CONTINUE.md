# Continue autonomous RhinoMCP improvement

This is the entry point for a development agent with no prior chat context.
Last updated: 2026-09-05. Verify repository and application state before acting;
the previous session's running processes and document selection are not assumptions.

## Objective and agreed design

Build a repeatable task → modeling → independent evaluation → planning → bounded
repair → retest workflow for RhinoMCP. Improve plugin code or modeling guidance
using evidence, while keeping the agent model and evaluator fixed during a
comparison. The long-term input includes reference pictures; start with objective
geometry tasks and generated references. No additional user data is needed now.

The approach is inspired by Harness-of-Harness:
https://arxiv.org/html/2609.01481v1

Use fresh agent sessions at role boundaries and saved artifacts for continuity.
Keep evaluator rules and hidden references outside agents' writable/access scope.
Use small, verifiable changes, developer checks before independent QA, preservation
tests, and a balance of repairs with new capabilities. Do not manufacture a plugin
defect when a task passes. The controller enforces boundaries; role prompts alone
are not isolation.

## Read in this order

1. Repository `AGENTS.md`: architecture, protocol change requirements, build rules,
   and the machine-local installation instruction.
2. This file: current state and next milestone.
3. `README.md` in this directory: startup and run commands.
4. `harness/README.md`: map of behavior, permissions, tasks and evaluator code.
5. `FIRST_LOOP.md`: completed live experiment and evidence locations.
6. `../docs/AUTONOMOUS_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`: full phased roadmap.

## Implemented and verified

- One box task: exactly one valid closed solid, minimum (0,0,0), XYZ dimensions
  100 × 50 × 30 mm, volume 150,000 mm³.
- A posed scalene triangular prism task: 80 × 40 mm local right-triangle profile,
  25 mm extrusion, +30° world-Z rotation then translation (120,-40,15) mm.
  A fresh live modeling/evaluation/planning cycle passed; the box regression passed.
- Explicit task-type schemas and pose-sensitive evaluation: six corners,
  containment, planar faces, straight edges, area and volume. Split planar faces
  are accepted. Prism fixtures independently use joined faces, not extrusion.
- Independent RhinoCommon measurements of saved `.3dm` files and analytic checks.
- Live fixtures: a correct box passes; wrong scale, wrong position, extra geometry,
  open surface, and wrong units fail. Repeated measurements agreed.
- Fresh Codex modeler and planner sessions, narrow MCP gateway, scoped approval
  for task-specific tools, timeouts, logs, artifact hashes, and explicit feedback input.
- A completed passing live loop, preceded by a failed attempt whose MCP creation
  calls were canceled by client configuration. The supervising development session
  fixed the configuration; the next attempt consumed the prior planner's findings.
- 193 existing Python tests and 23 experiment tests passed at the first milestone.
  The C# Release build passed and was installed before Rhino was launched.
- At the posed-prism milestone, 38 experiment tests passed and 15 live fixtures
  each produced their expected verdict twice (three valid forms, twelve flaws).
  The current server suite also passed all 223 tests.
  See `POSED_PRISM_LOOP.md` for the run records and verification details.

This demonstrates modeling/evaluation/planning, not autonomous plugin-code repair.
The successful modeler corrected the box's centered placement using returned bounds.
No production plugin behavior was changed for the first loop.

## Next concrete milestone

Expand objective task coverage with a through-hole task before enabling an
autonomous plugin builder:

1. Preserve both passing tasks as regression cases.
2. Define a solid with a specified through-hole, its location, diameter, depth,
   and expected volume. Extend the task schema and independent evaluator first.
3. Validate correct and deliberately wrong fixtures, including a blind hole,
   wrong hole location, and wrong diameter. Do not rely on volume alone.
4. Expose only the required boolean/modeling operations through the gateway.
5. Run a fresh modeler/evaluator/planner cycle and recheck the existing tasks.
6. If a reproducible plugin failure occurs, record a bounded repair plan and
   preserve the baseline. Never weaken the evaluator to make a candidate pass.

Then implement an isolated builder adapter and verified restart/reload plus
baseline/candidate comparison. The broader remaining task suite includes a
through-hole, profile extrusion, and reconstruction from generated orthographic
images. Basic profile extrusion is already exercised by the prism task. See the
roadmap for acceptance criteria.

## Known limits and operational lessons

- Rhino startup and `mcpstart` were performed by the supervising desktop agent.
  The Python runner requires an already-running listener and an empty unsaved doc.
- Do not reset or close unrelated user work. Inspect current state; create a new
  dedicated document. Never infer that the previous run's document is still active.
- No automatic plugin repair, automatic session resume, candidate promotion,
  rollback, full five-task suite, or real-photo evaluation is implemented yet.
- The gateway checks document identity but cannot lock out a human or external
  client. Current evaluation runs inside Rhino through the trusted C# bridge;
  stronger isolation is required before accepting untrusted plugin changes.
- The CLI uses its default model with personal configuration ignored. Explicit
  model/version recording and configurable adapters remain work for comparisons.
- Session `complete` is a claim, not acceptance. Read `evaluation.json` and actual
  logs. Do not blindly repeat a mutation after an interruption.
- The machine-local app-bundle copy belongs in local instructions, not tracked
  automation. A file replacement does not reload the active assembly.
- The prism's screenshot is clipped despite a passing saved-file geometry result.
  Capture framing is an open investigation, not a confirmed geometry failure.
- The prism modeler created already-transformed profile coordinates. Its successful
  pose is verified, but this run does not validate the optional rotation tool.

## Evidence and portability

`FIRST_LOOP.md` and `POSED_PRISM_LOOP.md` are portable summaries. Full local records are under ignored
`runs/` directories and may not exist on another machine. If absent, rerun the
fixtures and task; do not claim fresh verification from the historical report.
Do not rely on a chat session, sidebar task, or its internal memory for state.

Development is on the `harness` branch. Check `git status` and recent commits before
continuing; a working tree may contain work newer than this handoff. Full local run
artifacts remain ignored and are not transferred by checking out the branch.

After each development milestone, update this file with what is implemented,
verification results, unresolved issues and the next bounded step. Add a concise
report for important live runs; leave detailed logs in the run directory. Preserve
the distinction between implemented behavior and future roadmap items.
